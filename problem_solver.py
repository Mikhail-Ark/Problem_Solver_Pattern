    """Abstract class to generalize problem solvers' interfaces.

    Main purpose of class's child is to proccess online interpreter's
    (or user's) input and return correct answer according to problem
    statement. This abstract class is for cutting programmer's work
    during making the specific problem solver (and for training ofc=)).
    There is only two things to make left: how to split data to cases
    and how to solve particular case.

    Supports test mode (test mode needs check_method function to be
    imported). To enable test mode give ProblemSolver's child test data
    as an argument at initialization.

    Attributes:
        test_data (str): Initialization argument. Data to test object.
        test_mode (bool): Turns True if object got test_data.
        test_answers (str): Initialization argument. Answer to test.
        data_lines (list): Consists of strs, problem's raw data.
        cases (list): Consists of tuples, data processed for solving.
        answers (str): Answer to whole problem, combined of answers
            to all cases.
