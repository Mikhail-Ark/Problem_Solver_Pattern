There is a lot of problems at CodeAbbey to solve for beginners. During solving some of them (using Python) I realize that each problem solver repeats significant part of the code. To avoid those repeatitions I made this module.

Abstract class is a skeleton of each problem solver. All you have to do for problem solving is to write two methods:
  process_data() - the way you split your data to cases.
  solve_case() - solving of the particular case.

check_method() nicely vizualizes process of solving.

Good Luck!
